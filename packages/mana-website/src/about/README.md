# About Mana

## The goal

Pretty much every major framework out there is built around the idea of developing complex applications using web technologies. But the web doesn't only consist of web apps, there are also a ton of simple websites out there. Most of them also provide some kind of interactivity.

Making simple, interactive websites easier to develop is the goal of Mana. This is done in two ways:

1. Developers get a web app-framework-like experience, so there's less to care about while developing.
1. Front end people don't need to touch JavaScript at all. Everything is controlled via classes and attributes.

## The problem with most other frameworks

All well-known frameworks like React and Vue create and manage their own HTML. To some extend this also includes WebComponents. Websites are generally server rendered or pre rendered. This creates a conflict about who is the "ruler" of the markup. Mana, on the other hand, only updates existing HTML.

## About the name

Mana ‒ as known from the fantasy genre ‒ is the energy of life. It brings life to otherwise dead objects. Just like the concept of mana, the framework Mana brings "life" (= functionality) to the otherwise "dead" (= static) HTML.
